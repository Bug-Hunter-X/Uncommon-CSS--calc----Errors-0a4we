The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. For instance, the calculation may include incompatible units (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages) or be syntactically flawed, resulting in the browser ignoring the entire expression or applying an unintended default value.  Another issue is specificity conflicts where rules with higher specificity override the styles applied with `calc()`, rendering it ineffective.  Finally, the browser's support for complex `calc()` expressions might vary, potentially creating inconsistencies across different platforms.
