# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function and provides solutions to address them.

## Bug Description

The `calc()` function is a powerful tool, but it's easy to make mistakes. This example covers cases where incompatible units are used, syntax errors exist, specificity conflicts interfere with the calculation's effect, and inconsistencies arise due to differences in browser implementations.

## Files

- `bugSolution.css`: Shows how to fix the issues identified in `bug.css`. 

## How to Reproduce

2. Open `bug.html` (or create a simple HTML file that links to `bug.css`) in your browser.
3. Observe the unexpected layout.
4. Replace `bug.css` with `bugSolution.css` to see the corrected layout.
